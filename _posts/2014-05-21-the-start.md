This is the beginning of the project. I'm purposely keeping tight lips on the project until I have something to show for it, but a lexer, parser, compiler, and vm are at various stages of design and development. Shorter-term goals have been identified, and longer-term goals are too lofty to even state for fear of being ridiculed at such an early stage.

So why is this here? Well, I bought a domain name and *something* has to go here right?
