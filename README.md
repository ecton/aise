Aise is a simple, C++ written [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))-like language. Its goals are:

* Be extremely portable (iOS, Android (via JNI + NDK), Mac, Windows, Linux)
* Be very easy to embed into apps
* Follow common best practices with regards to Unicode, time zones/dates, endianness, etc.
* Be simple and predictable
* Satisfy the language-design passions of [nilobject](https://github.com/nilobject)
